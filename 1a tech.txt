Program Description:
This program is designed to pre-sell a limited number of cinema tickets. The program starts with 20 tickets available for purchase, and each buyer can buy up to 4 tickets.
---
Logical Steps:
Step 1: Initialize the total number of tickets (total_tickets) to 20 and the maximum number of tickets per buyer (max_tickets_per_buyer) to 4. 
Set total_buyers to 0 as an accumulator to keep track of the number of buyers.
Step 2: Enter a loop that continues until all tickets are sold (total_tickets > 0).
Step 3: Inside the loop, prompt the user to input the number of tickets they want to buy.
---
Variables:
1. total_tickets (Integer): Tracks the remaining number of cinema tickets available for sale. Initially set to 20.
2. total_buyers (Integer): Accumulator variable that counts the number of buyers who have purchased tickets.
3. tickets_requested (Integer): Stores the number of tickets requested by the user in each iteration of the loop.
